                                <h2>What is Composer?</h2>
                                <p>Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will install them in your project for you.</p>
                                <h4>Dependency Management</h4>
                                <p>Composer is not a package manager. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. vendor) inside your project. By default it will never install anything globally. Thus, it is a dependency manager.</p>
                                <p>This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler. But there has not been such a tool for PHP.</p>
                                <h4>The problem Composer solves:</h4>
                                <ol>
                                        <li>You have a project that depends on a number of libraries.</li>
                                        <li>Some of those libraries depend on other libraries.</li>
                                        <li>You declare the things you depend on.</li>
                                        <li>Composer finds out which versions of which packages need to be installed, and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).</li>
                                </ol>
